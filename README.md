#Gamify The Robotics World

##About The Project

In my project, I am gamifying the robotics world. In this i am combining the robotics world with the gaming world. For this i am creating series of prototypes.

>Gamify The Real Mobile Tank
Often a human life is at risk when driver is participating in a racing sport or even driving on a normal road. This solution will enable a driver to control a real mobile tank or any other vehicle in a remote way, through a game. That is driver will play a game that in turn will move the real vehicle and hence participate in the race sport / normal driving. Driver can also keep the vehicle in autonomous mode when he/she is tired or taking a break.
Currently I am having a small mobile tank. I am going to build a game in Unity. And through the unity game I will control a real mobile tank. I have already made a demo project similar to this which is using python script to communicate game movements to the motors of the tank. My first prototype (https://www.delhitechnologyclub.com/gamifymobiletank) uses raspberry pi.Human mind learns quickly if trained through a game. It is a unique solution in its own, where human can learn to operate real vehicles through a game. The game is useful because human can be trained well and even can be made to participate in live race without putting life at risk.
