# Gamify The Robotics World
## About The Project

In my project, I am gamifying the robotics world. In this i am combining the robotics world with the gaming world. I build the following prototypes:

1) Gamify The Real Mobile Tank
Often a human life is at risk when driver is participating in a racing sport or even driving on a normal road. This solution will enable a driver to control a real mobile tank or any other vehicle in a remote way, through a game. That is driver will play a game that in turn will move the real vehicle and hence participate in the race sport / normal driving. Driver can also keep the vehicle in autonomous mode when he/she is tired or taking a break.
Robots are the future. Before letting a robot control human, let us see how we can control a robot. We have started with very basic robot which is basically a tank, which is being controlled wirelessly by a keyboard. Itâ€™s a embedded program in python that is taking inputs from keyboard and sending signals to motors attached to tank. And the program is running on a small raspberry pi with raspbian os.
